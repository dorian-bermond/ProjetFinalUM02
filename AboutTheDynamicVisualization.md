# About my dynamic Visualization

## What is it ?

My dynamic visualization allow the user to have a barchart depending on the parameters he can chose. The choice is made by ticking boxes on the right of the barchart.
In X, he can chose :
 - Country (US states united or divided) ;
 - Category of style ;
 - Style ;
 - Availability through the year.
In Y, he can chose : 
 - Amount of beers ;
 - Average Alcohol By Volume(ABV).

## Why did I do it ?

I think the users might want to have really different general information which is not easy to get on the same graph.
